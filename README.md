## Course Description

This two-part course teaches data modeling and Structured Query Language (SQL). In the database design curriculum, students learn to analyze complex business scenarios and create a data model, a conceptual representation of an organization’s information. In the database programming with SQL curriculum, students implement their database design by creating a physical database using SQL, the industry-standard database programming language.  Upon completion of this course, students have the opportunity to take an exam to earn the industry certification Oracle Database SQL Certified Expert. 

## Course Objectives

1.	Students will gain knowledge of database management systems, both in terms of use and implementation/design
2.	Students understand the stages of database design and implementation
3.	Students understand database programming basic theory
4.	Students understand the importance of effective interfaces in the interaction between humans and computer systems
5.	Students demonstrate the ability to enter and advance within professional organizations

## Course Expectations

* Come prepared (Arrive on time, have all assignments completed. Use bathroom before entering classroom.)
* Be polite (Speak respectfully to teachers and students.  Do not disrupt another student’s learning.)
* Be productive (Complete all warm-ups and assignments on time. Be an active learner. Take notes.  No distractions. No sleeping.)
* No food or drinks are allowed in the lab at any time.
* Follow all Oak Ridge rules including the [Honor Code](#dbsql-honor-code).
* Unless otherwise instructed by the teacher, students shall turn off, not use, and keep out of sight cell phones and other signaling devices during the class period. Furthermore, any listening, recording, or videotaping of peers, teachers, or visitor to the classroom without prior consent is prohibited. Consequences follow ORHS policy as stated in student handbook.
* **Absences:** Absent work is given two days to complete for every day missed.  It is always the student’s responsibility to determine what they missed when absent.  

## DBSQL Honor Code

**You are expected to submit your own work in this course.** 
In particular, attempting to take credit for someone else’s work by turning it in as your own constitutes plagiarism, which is a serious violation of the Oak Ridge High School academic integrity policy.  This does not mean that any discussion of assignments is somehow a violation of the integrity policy. In computer science courses, it is usually appropriate to ask others for hints and debugging help or to talk generally about problem-solving strategies and program structure
 
**You must not share actual program code with other students.** 
In particular, you should not ask anyone to give you a copy of their code or, conversely, give your code to another student who asks you for it. Similarly, you should not discuss your algorithmic strategies to such an extent that you and your collaborators end up turning in exactly the same code. Discuss ideas together, but do the coding on your own. 

**You must be prepared to explain any program code you submit.** 
Sometimes students change their code by rewriting comments, changing variable names, and so forth, to disguise the fact that their work is copied from someone else. If you wrote the code yourself, you will be able to explain it.  I may ask you to modify a particular method or explain an algorithm you were expected to create.  If you are unable to do this, no credit will be given for the assignment. 

## Computer Security Policy

* Computers in our lab have a security software program. This software disables many of the features you might find common to other computers, including any home computer you might have. The software also monitors and records all use by the student and may be used for disciplinary purposes.
* Do not attempt to defeat or disable the security software. 
* Do not change the desktop environment, which includes the color, fonts, video display mode, screen saver, icon arrangement, and especially the wallpaper. 
* Do not download files onto your computer's hard drive without specific permission from your instructor. 
* Do not install any programs on your computer. 
* Do not delete or rename any file on your computer's hard drive or any other school computer unless it is one that you created. 
* Do not copy any software on any school computer for your personal use. This is illegal. If you want a copy, buy your own.

## Grading

Percentages | Weights  
----------- | --------- 
90%  - 100% :   	A | Digital Portfolio - 10%
80%  -  89% :  	B | Soft Skills - 20%
70%  -  79% :     C | iLearning Quizzes/Tests - 20%
60%  -  69% :  	D | Projects - 50%
Below 60% :    	F |  

**Digital Portfolio:**  Students will create a digital portfolio on [Portfolium](https://portfolium.com/).  Evidence of work will be posted througout the semester.

**Soft Skills:** Skills including collaboration, work readiness, behavior/attitude, work ethic and motivation/initiative. These skills are required for success in school and career and are developed through teamwork, professional behavior expectations, communication and collaborative assignments. 

**iLearning Quizzes/Tests:** Oracle iLearning portal includeds quizzes after each lesson and a midterm and final exam test.  Students have unlimited retake attempts for quizzes and one attempt at the midterm and final exam.

**Projects:** Students will pick a semester long project, which will include implementation of a database.
